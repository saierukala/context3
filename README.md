##  Context
Context can also be used:

When data has to be available between different Routes.
When data has to be available for more number of Components

## 2. Using Context in methods
We can add consumer or provider in the class method when it returns JSX.

In the below code snippet, we have used Consumer Component in renderProductDetailsView because this method is returning JSX.

# Example:

# File: src/components/ProductItemDetails
